# JAX-FSM-MCMC: Vectorized MCMC without synchronization barriers

This repository contains JAX implementations of several stochastic-length proposal MCMC algorithms (i.e. HMC-NUTS and Slice sampling variants) for more efficient execution on SIMD architectures, when vectorizating with `vmap`. The implementation method is based on the paper "Efficiently Vectorized MCMC on Modern Accelerators" [https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2503.17405](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2503.17405). 

### TL;DR

- **Issue:** Wrapping a data-dependent `while` loop in `jax.vmap` produces a single batched `While` with an aggregeated termination condition for the whole batch, so each iteration stalls until **all** batch elements finishâ€”creating a full-batch synchronization barrier.

- **Solution:** We split the computation at each loop boundary into separate blocks, then use `jax.lax.switch` or `jax.lax.cond` to dispatch each block until every chain recovers its required samples. This lets each Markov chain progress through its own state sequence independently, eliminating the synchronization barrier.
