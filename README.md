# JAX-FSM-MCMC: Vectorized MCMC without synchronization barriers

This repository contains JAX implementations of several stochastic-length proposal MCMC algorithms (i.e. HMC-NUTS and Slice sampling variants) for more efficient execution on SIMD architectures, when vectorizating with `vmap`. The implementation method is based on the paper "Efficiently Vectorized MCMC on Modern Accelerators" [https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2503.17405](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2503.17405). 

### TL;DR

- **Issue:** Wrapping a data-dependent `while` loop in `jax.vmap` produces a single batched `While` operation with an aggregated termination condition for the whole batch, so each iteration stalls until **all** batch elements finishâ€”creating a full-batch synchronization barrier.

- **Solution:** We split the computation at each loop boundary into separate blocks, then use `jax.lax.switch` or `jax.lax.cond` to dispatch each block until every chain recovers its required samples. This lets each Markov chain progress through its own state sequence independently, eliminating the synchronization barrier.

## Getting Started 
Below is a minimal example showing how to run a collection of NUTS chains using the FSM approach. For more advanced usage (slice samplers, customization, etc.), see the API Overview section.


### Basic Usage 
 Import jax, numpy and the FSM machinery we will use to sample MCMC chains with NUTS.
 
```python
# Basic imports
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import jax.random as jrnd
import numpy as np

# FSM imports
from FSM.mcmc.nuts_bundle import NutsFSM # NUTS algorithm in FSM form
from FSM.base.run_fsm_in import jitted_update # Jitted function to call blocks of the FSM
from FSM.base.run_fsm_in import get_fsm_samples_chain as get_fsm_samples # Outer wrapper to get n-samples per chain

# Helper to create log likelihood for GPR
from FSM.utils.gpr import logpdf_gp_fn as get_logpdf_fn
```
